# Faction March

A faction territory war where orders are Sepolia transactions that only take
effect once someone proves them to Creditcoin. See
[`faction-march-build-plan.md`](./faction-march-build-plan.md) for the full
design and phase-by-phase build plan.

**Status: Phase 1 (feasibility spike) complete for the no-auth parts; Phase 2
(scaffold) done.** See [`spikes/FINDINGS.md`](./spikes/FINDINGS.md) for
results.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `contracts/source/` | Foundry project for Ethereum Sepolia (`OrderBook.sol`, Phase 3) |
| `contracts/creditcoin/` | Foundry project for Creditcoin CC3 (`FactionMarch.sol`, `ProofGate.sol`, `WarChest.sol`) |
| `courier/` | Node/TS proof-delivery daemon (Phase 8) |
| `web/` | Frontend (Phase 10) |
| `spikes/` | Phase 1 feasibility scripts and findings |

## Setup

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in RPC URLs / a throwaway funded key, see spikes/README.md
```

Chain-info spike (no wallet needed):

```sh
npm run spike:chain-info
```

Full attestation round-trip (needs a funded throwaway wallet — see `spikes/README.md`):

```sh
npm run spike:full
```

Contracts:

```sh
npm run build:contracts
npm run test:contracts
```
